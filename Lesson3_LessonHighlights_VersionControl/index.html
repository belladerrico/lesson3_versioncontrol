            <p class="lead">One way to keep track of files and their stages it to save each change as its own file.  This may be sufficient for an individual who has only a few files.  This is not the best strategy, however, on a larger.  Version control is the solution to file sharing issues when dealing with multiple people working on multiple, larger projects.  Version control is where all files and their stages are saved on one repository that can be accessed by multiple people on multiple devices.  Version control makes it possible for members to edit files at the same time without causing issues. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System (VCS) is what makes file sharing, editing, and saving possible.  The system automatically traces who edits files, when files were edited, and saves the changes.  While the system saves changes it does not delete files.  Each stage of a file is saved as its own file on the repository.  This could be beneficial to not only big companies, but also individuals who may need to go back to an older version of a file.  Another huge benefit is the ability to work on the same file as someone else simultaneously.  The system can even merge files on the repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The repository is the backbone of the version control system.  The repository is like a virtual file cabinet.  All files are stored in the repository, along with all versions of the files.  The repository pushes and pulls files from team members so no version is ever lost or out of place.  There are two types of repositories.  The first is a remote repository.  A remote repository exists on a remote server that multiple people connect to from remote devices.  A local repository exists on an individual’s device.  You can create a new repository or use an existing remote repository by copying it to your machine.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a commonly used version control system that is free.  GIT can perform version control commands to make file sharing and projects possible for individuals or large groups.  In fact, many big businesses use GIT: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Netflix, and more.  GIT uses commands to add, commit, and push files through the system.  The basic cycle of GIT commands is a working copy of a file is added from the sandbox to the staging area.  From the staging area the file is pushed to the final destination (remote repository).  The advantages of using GIT include a copy of the repository data is stored on the local machine, faster processing, and files cannot be overwritten.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As mentioned earlier, there are two ways to get a repository.  You can import an already existing repository or create your own.  To initialize a repository, you will use commands git init, git add, and git commit.  This is the start to tracking files in your repository.  To clone or import and existing repository, you will use the command ‘git clone’.  You will use the link to represent what repository you are cloning.  Another option is to use the SSH key to clone an existing repository.  Once you have set up your repository you can use the command git status to check the status of your files.  </p>
